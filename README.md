## How to use

 **Adding time**
 
Adding time in Foundations

   To add time on foundations product, you need to go to your exercises, and click ignore or resolve one question at least. Once this is done, a time field should appear on the extension page on which you can add your time.
Adding time in Fluency builder

   To add time on fluency builder product, you need to go to your exercises, and answer at least one exercise. If the add time field does not appear, it means that no time request was caught, you need to refresh the question and answer it once again. To have the time added, you need to finish the lesson you used to add time.

*Note: If you don't see the add time field, it means that the actions you took on Rosetta stone website did not lead to adding legitimate time, and therefore, you need to answer other questions.*
